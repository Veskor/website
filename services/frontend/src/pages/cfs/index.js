              The main idea of this conference is to bring together experts
              from academia & business with young people who want to lear more
              about Python. Our goal is not just to promote Python but also to
              connect developers with companies who use Python.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.paragraph}>
              We believe that if we get to know each other better and exchange
              ideas we can create a stronger community that can work together
              on different projects.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.paragraph}>
              That is the main reason why we are offering our sponsoring
              companies an opportunity to present their work in the business
              room. Every company that donates more than 300 euros will get one
              business presentation where you can talk about your projects,
              ideas and hiring process. In the end of the business talks we
              highly encourage your HR to continue with the sourcing process if
              you find a desirable candidate.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.paragraph}>
              After the conference we are planning to open a PyDev mailing list.
              Since we strongly believe in privacy of our developers this
              mailing list will only be used to promote job offers from our gold
              and diamond sponsors. The email list will never be used for spam or
              sold to a third party.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.paragraph}>
              To our diamond sponsors we specially offer an opportunity to
              promote their job offers on our job board that will be available
              after the conference.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.paragraph}>
              We are open for any additional ideas you might have on how to
              promote Python and create stronger ties in our community. Contact
              us if you are interested in learning more about the sponsoring
              options.
